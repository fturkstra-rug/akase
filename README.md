## Tools

- Akase: A search engine powered by our argumentation knowledge graph, will be released soon.
- Argsbase: A multi-agent interface for structured human–AI deliberation. Request access [here](mailto:khalid.alkhatib@rug.nl).

## Code

The `argmining_pipeline` contains code for two pipelines. 

1. Use `run_pipeline.py` to perform argumentative sentence detection, argumentative component classification and argumentative relation classification. 
2. Use `run_asd.py` to perform argumentative sentence detection at a large-scale (millions of documents).

## Data

The file `issues.json` contains a list of controversial issues and corresponding arguments scraped from online debating platforms.
The argumentation knowledge graph itself is still under construction and will be made available here as soon as possible.
